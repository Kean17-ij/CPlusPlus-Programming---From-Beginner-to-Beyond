//FILES, STREAMS AND IO

/*

C++ provides a stream abstraction to work with IO devices. A stream is independent to the type of device. A stream is a sequence of bytes.

 C++ provides different types of streams:
 - Input stream provides data to the program from the input device
 - Output stream receives data from the program and sends it to the output device
